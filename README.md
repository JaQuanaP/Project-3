# Car Ownership Prediction

This project aims to predict future car ownership trends based on various factors using machine learning techniques. The analysis is conducted in a Jupyter Notebook (`CarOwnership.ipynb`), where data is processed, visualized, and modeled to understand the key determinants influencing the likelihood of owning a car.

## Project Overview

The notebook includes the following sections:
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Importing and cleaning the dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data to identify trends and correlations.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating and selecting important features for prediction.
- **Model Building**: Training different machine learning models to predict car ownership.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the models using appropriate metrics and selecting the best-performing model.
- **Prediction and Future Trends**: Making predictions on future car ownership trends based on the chosen model.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you will need the following packages installed in your Python environment:


- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `jupyter`
